   - Program 3 also requires the following header files: [Header File 1](/headers/header1.h), [Header File 2](/headers/header2.h)

Please refer to the individual program directories for more details on each program.

## Installation

To use these programs on an MSP430FR microcontroller, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Set up your development environment for MSP430FR programming (e.g., Code Composer Studio, Energia, etc.).

3. Connect your MSP430FR microcontroller to your development environment.

4. Build and flash the desired program onto the microcontroller.

## Usage

After you have successfully installed the programs on your MSP430FR microcontroller, you can execute them according to your requirements. Modify the programs as needed and upload them to your microcontroller for execution.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a program that you would like to add to the collection, or if you find any issues or improvements, please submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

These programs were developed with the assistance of a free course provided by Texas Instruments. We would like to thank Texas Instruments for their support and resources in learning and developing programs for the MSP430FR family of microcontrollers.
